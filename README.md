# SMART-Q-BANK-SOLUTION-
This project offers a smart approach and solution to subject-wise preparation, featuring various types of questions, including descriptive and multiple-choice questions, on a web platform where teachers can provide the questions. The project aims to create a database of questions on an IT-supported platform and provide faculty members with the option to create different types of question papers of varying difficulty levels on demand. The project focuses on the development and deployment of a smart solution for subject-wise preparation of question banks for implementation at an institution. The solution is expected to be used primarily by members of the faculty who would create questions pertaining to different units of different subjects of varying levels of difficulty.
The planned solution is expected to not only maintain a repository for such questions but also provide the stakeholders with the option to create question papers speedily and on demand. It will be very helpful for the online assessment. The application will have 3 types of users: teachers, reviewers, and admins. The technologies used in this project include ReactJS, Material UI, NodeJS, Express.js, and MariaDB for the backend database, React-Redux, and MVC Framework. Two different types of Dashboards will open for the teacherâ€™s login and the reviewer's login on the other side. This web page is to create questions for students and check how much they are preparing.
